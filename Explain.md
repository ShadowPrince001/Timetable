# Timetable Creator and Automated Attendance System  

This repository contains the presentation for **HackHeritage 3.0 – Problem Statement HH310** submitted by **Team Chronocoders**. The project proposes a **Web-based Timetable Creator and Automated Attendance System** to simplify scheduling and attendance tracking for educational institutions.  

## 📌 Overview  
The solution is designed to:  
- Generate **conflict-free timetables**.  
- Track **student attendance in real-time**.  
- Provide **role-based dashboards** for admins, faculty, and students.  
- Offer **analytics and automated alerts** for better monitoring.  

## 🚀 Core Features (as presented in PPT)  
1. **Smart Timetable Generator**  
   - Creates optimal schedules considering faculty availability, classroom capacity, and equipment requirements.  

2. **Multi-Role System**  
   - Admins: Manage system & schedules.  
   - Faculty: Track attendance.  
   - Students: View personal schedules.  

3. **Automated Attendance**  
   - Real-time attendance tracking synced with generated timetables.  

4. **Advanced Analytics**  
   - Live dashboards with attendance trends and alerts.  

## ⚙️ Technical Approach  
- **Backend**: Python (Flask) with scalable architecture.  
- **Database**: SQLite / PostgreSQL.  
- **Deployment**: Cloud-ready (Heroku/Render).  
- **Scalability**: Designed for phased implementation with redundancy and monitoring.  

## 📊 Feasibility & Viability  
- **Technical Feasibility**: High – built on proven technologies (Flask/Python).  
- **Market Feasibility**: High – strong need in EdTech adoption.  
- **Challenges**: Data migration, performance scaling, downtime impact.  
- **Mitigation**: Phased rollouts, pilot programs, redundant systems.  

## 🌍 Impact & Benefits  
- **Institutions**: 60% reduction in scheduling conflicts and manual workload.  
- **Faculty**: Saves 15+ hours per week through automated attendance.  
- **Students**: Transparent and reliable attendance tracking.  
- **Parents**: Real-time access to attendance & academic progress.  
- **Overall**: 60% decrease in administrative overhead, improved retention rates.
