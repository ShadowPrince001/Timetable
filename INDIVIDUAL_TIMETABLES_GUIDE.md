# üóìÔ∏è Individual Timetables System Guide

## Overview
The Timetable & Attendance System now provides **individual timetables** for each student group and each teacher, ensuring that every group and teacher has their own distinct schedule rather than a single shared timetable.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Individual Student Group Timetables**
- **Each student group gets its own timetable** with unique class schedules
- **Group-specific constraints** prevent double-booking within the same group
- **Visual weekly grid view** showing the complete schedule for each group
- **Quick access** from the main admin timetable page

### 2. **Individual Teacher Timetables**
- **Each teacher has their own teaching schedule** across all groups they teach
- **Teacher-specific views** showing all classes they're assigned to
- **Teaching statistics** including total classes, unique courses, and student groups
- **Quick access** from the users management page

### 3. **Smart Conflict Prevention**
- **No double-booking within groups**: A student group can't have two classes at the same time
- **No teacher conflicts**: A teacher can't teach two classes simultaneously
- **No classroom conflicts**: A classroom can't host two classes at the same time
- **Global resource management**: Ensures efficient use of classrooms and teachers

## üèóÔ∏è Database Structure

### Timetable Model
```python
class Timetable(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    course_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('course.id'), nullable=False)
    classroom_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('classroom.id'), nullable=False)
    time_slot_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('time_slot.id'), nullable=False)
    teacher_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)
    student_group_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('student_group.id'), nullable=False)
    semester = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)
    academic_year = db.Column(db.String(10), nullable=False)
```

### Key Relationships
- **Each timetable entry belongs to ONE student group**
- **Each timetable entry has ONE teacher**
- **Each timetable entry uses ONE classroom and time slot**
- **Multiple groups can have different classes at the same time (in different classrooms)**

db.UniqueConstraint('student_group_id', 'classroom_id', 'time_slot_id', 'semester', 'academic_year')
db.UniqueConstraint('student_group_id', 'teacher_id', 'time_slot_id', 'semester', 'academic_year')
```

### Global Resource Constraints
```python
# No classroom conflicts across groups
db.UniqueConstraint('classroom_id', 'time_slot_id', 'semester', 'academic_year')
# No teacher conflicts across groups
db.UniqueConstraint('teacher_id', 'time_slot_id', 'semester', 'academic_year')
```

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

- **All individual timetable views** are mobile-friendly

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **"No Timetable Available" Message**
- **Cause**: Group has no assigned courses or timetable entries
- **Solution**: Assign courses to the group or generate timetables

#### 2. **Missing Teacher Information**
- **Cause**: Teacher not properly assigned to timetable entries
- **Solution**: Check teacher assignments in timetable entries

#### 3. **Empty Timetable Views**
- **Cause**: No timetable entries exist for the group/teacher
- **Solution**: Create timetable entries or run automatic generation

### Best Practices

1. **Always assign courses to student groups** before generating timetables
2. **Use the automatic generation** feature for initial timetable creation
3. **Review individual timetables** after making changes
4. **Check for conflicts** when manually adding entries
5. **Export timetables** for backup and sharing purposes
