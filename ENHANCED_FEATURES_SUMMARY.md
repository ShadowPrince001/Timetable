    # New fields added:
    required_equipment = db.Column(db.Text)  # Equipment required for the course
    min_capacity = db.Column(db.Integer, default=1)  # Minimum classroom capacity required
    
    # Removed: teacher_id (now handled by CourseTeacher model)
    # Enhanced constraints:
    __table_args__ = (
        db.CheckConstraint('credits >= 1 AND credits <= 6', name='check_credits_range'),
        db.CheckConstraint('max_students >= 1 AND max_students <= 200', name='check_max_students'),
        db.CheckConstraint('min_capacity >= 1', name='check_min_capacity'),
    )
```

#### **New CourseTeacher Model:**
```python
class CourseTeacher(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    course_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('course.id'), nullable=False)
    teacher_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)
    is_primary = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)  # Primary teacher for the course
    assigned_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    
    # Constraints:
    __table_args__ = (
        db.UniqueConstraint('course_id', 'teacher_id', name='unique_course_teacher'),
    )
```

### **🔒 ENHANCED CONSTRAINTS:**

#### **Equipment Validation:**
```python
# Check equipment constraints
if course.required_equipment:
    required_equipment = [eq.strip().lower() for eq in course.required_equipment.split(',')]
    classroom_equipment = [eq.strip().lower() for eq in (classroom.equipment or '').split(',')]
    
    missing_equipment = [eq for eq in required_equipment if eq and eq not in classroom_equipment]
    if missing_equipment:
        flash(f'Classroom {classroom.room_number} is missing required equipment: {", ".join(missing_equipment)}', 'error')
```

#### **Capacity Validation:**
```python
# Check classroom capacity constraint
if classroom.capacity < course.min_capacity:
    flash(f'Classroom {classroom.room_number} capacity ({classroom.capacity}) is less than required minimum ({course.min_capacity})', 'error')
```
